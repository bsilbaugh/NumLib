                        NumLib - Python Bindings
===========================================================================

This contains the Python language bindings for the NumLib library. The
directory structure mimicks that of a typical python package. In
general, there is a python module for each NumLib C++ library.

By default, the python bindings are installed inplace. If you wish to 
actually install the python bindings, copy the numlib directory to the 
site-packages directory under your python install directory.

Generation of python bindings was facilitated by the Boost.Python
library. Each NumLib python module requires dynamic linkage with
the boost_python library (e.g. libboost_python.so). This library
contains a global registry of automatic python/numlib type conversions 
which is shared by all boost.python modules imported by the python 
interpretor. This global registry enables separate projects which
use NumLib to avoid having to reimplement the python bindings for
NumLib types and/or redefine python/NumLib type convertions.
