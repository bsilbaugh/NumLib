                        A C++ numerical library
===========================================================================

DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The objective of this library is to provide a consistent set of tools 
for numerical computing in C++, while also provide efficient array 
interoperability with Fortran and Python numerical libraries. The objective 
is not to compete with NumPy, or future Python numerical libraries, but to 
provide a library that is interoperable with such libraries while 
facilitating the rapid development of hybrid Python/C++ computational 
software.

	Many numerical libraries already exist within the C++ community; e.g. 
Boost uBlas, MTL, Blitz++, TNT (NIST), LAPACK++, JAMA, etc. So one approach 
would be to simply develop python bindings for one of these. However, each 
of these libraries seem to only provide a subset of the tools needed to
support the development of computational mechanics software. 

	In regards to performance, the philosphy adopted here is, if one
can deligate the CPU intensive task to optimized Fortran libraries
(e.g. system tuned LAPACK or FFT libraries) then why not use these?
Thus, while the focus of this library is to provide tools for numerical
computing in C++, the implementation of some C++ class methods may be 
delagated to legacy fortran libraries (either system installed libraries 
or internal fortran code snipets). An alternative is to use advanced 
templating techniques; however, these methods at best match the 
performance of a Fortran library. It remains to be shown that templating 
techniques can consistently exceed a tuned Fortran library (e.g. ATLAS).
